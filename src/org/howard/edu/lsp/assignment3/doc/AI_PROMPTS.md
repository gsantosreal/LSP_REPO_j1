Prompt:
can you help me brain storm ways to make the following etl pipeline code more object oriented? <pasted Assignment 2 code>

Excerpt from Response:
Potential Class Structure Ideas:
ETLPipeline (orchestrator)
DataReader / DataWriter (interfaces)
Product (domain object)
TransformationStrategy (interface)
ETLResult (to encapsulate output metrics)

Prompt:
how many classes do you recommend i have, if one of them is the product class

Excerpt from Response:
Essential Classes (4 core):
Product - Your domain model
ETLPipeline - Main orchestrator that coordinates everything
DataReader - Handles reading input files
DataWriter - Handles writing output files

Optional but Recommended (+1-2 classes):
ProductTransformer - Dedicated transformation logic (separate from pipeline orchestration)
ETLResult - Encapsulates pipeline execution results and metrics

Why This Structure Works Well:
Product: Pure data model - no business logic
ETLPipeline: Orchestrates flow without doing actual work
Reader/Writer: Single responsibility for I/O
Transformer: Focused only on data transformation rules
ETLResult: Clean output handling (optional but nice)

Prompt:
should i use throws ioexception

Excerpt from Response:
throws IOException is used to propagate errors up the call stack rather than handling them immediately. Here's why it's used in your refactored code:

What throws IOException Does:
Declares that a method might throw an IOException
Forces callers to handle or declare the exception
Separates business logic from error handling

Prompt:
can you explain how line.split(",") works

Excerpt from Response:
How Array Size is Determined:
When you call line.split(","), Java:
Counts how many segments the string splits into
Creates an array of exactly that size
Returns the fixed-size array

Prompt:
why use and excecute method and not just do everything in main

Excerpt from Response:
Bottom Line:
Using execute() makes your code more object-oriented, testable, and maintainable. The main() method should be just an entry point, not contain all your business logic.

That said, for a simple assignment, putting everything in main() works fine too! The execute() method is about following good OO principles.

Prompt:
can you write the javadocs for the following files not including private methods <pasted all code>

Response:
<pasted code with javadocs which i tweaked a little>
